       "Agent-centric AI frameworks solidify 2025. Pocketflow emerges as a Python framework for Human-AI co-design, with flow-based orchestration, modular Nodes, Flow-as-Node, and explicit control to manage complex agent workflows. LightAgent, a lightweight open-source framework, adds memory, tools, and Tree-of-Thought, with a 0.4.0 release in June 2025 and MCP protocol integration for cross-model tool use. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03771?utm_source=openai))\n",
       "\n",
       "Beyond orchestration, RL-driven and testing frameworks proliferate. Agent Lightning presents a flexible approach to train any AI agent with reinforcement learning, decoupling agent execution from training to work with existing stacks (e.g., LangChain, AutoGen); published Aug 2025. DoomArena provides a plug-in framework to stress-test AI agents against evolving security threats, enabling configurable threat models. PiFlow proposes a principled, information-theoretic multi-agent framework for automated scientific discovery. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03680?utm_source=openai))\n",

Intel’s OpenVINO 2025.3 (Sept 3, 2025) expands GenAI coverage, adds model support, and boosts NPU integration for efficient edge/cloud/local deployments. This release tightens model conversion, hardware acceleration, and pipeline capabilities for agentic workflows.
